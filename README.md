# USPY 🕵️ - Backend

This is the official repository for the [USPY](https://uspy.me) Backend! Here you can find how to run the application youself and some brief explanation on the code repository.

## Package organization

This repository is organized in these packages:

```
config
db
entity
iddigital
main
server/
├── controllers/
│   ├── account
│   ├── private
│   ├── public
│   └── restricted
├── middleware
└── models/
    ├── account
    ├── private
    ├── public
    └── restricted
utils
```

Their respective responsibilities are the following:

#### **config**
    - Environment configuration/initialization

#### **db**
    - Database Access Object and database initialization

#### **entity**
    - All object definitions and their bindings to HTTP requests and their database objects

#### **iddigital**
    - Wrapper functions for interacting with the USP iddigital API and Records' PDF parsing.

#### **main**
    - Entrypoint for the web server and backend endpoints definitions

#### **server**
    - Endpoint closures and their implementations
    - Middleware contains useful middleware functions, such as JWT validation and data binding
    - Endpoint implementation uses a Model-Controller structure
    - This M-C can be divided into four categories:
        - Account: all operations related to the user's account management, such as login, signup, delete, etc
        - Private: all operations related to the user's data management, such as their grades and reviews
        - Public: all operations related to data that is public (including non-registered users), such as subject data
        - Restricted: all operations related to data that is only accessible by registered users (aggregated data)


#### **utils**
    - Utility functions such as hashing functions and encoding stuff

### Cloud Services

The following services are used by the backend application:

### Firestore:
    - Non relational database. Used to store all persistent data.
    - Must be accessed with an IAM key when running locally or just with the project ID if in production

### Cloud run:
    - Serverless application that will run the web server
    - Can be set up manually, but also through cloud build using the cloubuild.yaml configuration file
    - Runs the web server by building the container using the Dockerfile in the repository
